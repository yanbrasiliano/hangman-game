## Overview

## How to Play

1. The game will prompt you to guess letters one at a time.
2. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
3. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman figure being drawn.
4. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or exhaust all 6 attempts.
